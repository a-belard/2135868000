# Flutter developer testing project
in flutter it is common to have data be offline first then at somepoint you want to back the data to the cloud,
In this project we want you to show us how you can keep the local data backed-up online and ensure more than one user will have same copy of the data
# Use the following tech
- https://pub.dev/packages/isar (for local data)
- http://pocketbase.io/ (for data backup )
- https://pub.dev/packages/stock ( in case you need to merge two data source
The demo should be easy only two model to proove the concept is enough, ensure good coding practice and having unit testing and integration testing is added bonus
Keep the demo easy but show the concept in a more efficient way, use https://www.vidyard.com/ to record the demo
- Send PR detailing the work done and with clear documentation, after this next interview will be scheduled.

# Bonus point for a candidate
- It will be nice if this is close to synchronization with multiple users maybe 2 users able to use one data point e.g when you edit google doc both changes shows
